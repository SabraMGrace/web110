           <h2>Designing Forms</h2>
        
            <p>Years ago when I opened a music school, like many business owners, I did not know how helpful good form design could be. I was unaware of the ENORMOUS impact that this one, small and simple tool could have on my life as a business owner, and that of my employees. I truly believe that designing good web forms can make your business thrive or flounder.</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Forms streamline work for both your customer and your employees.</li>
                <li>Forms can make initial interactions frustration-free for everyone - you AND your customer!</li>
                <li>Forms make it easier for your to track prospects.</li>
                <li>Forms can organize information for you. And who doesn’t love less work?!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Best of all for CMS, forms are trackable. Forms may not seem exciting, but they will absolutely help you increase your customer conversion rates and profit margins if designed well. As with any tool, you want your forms to be designed well. Good design is a thoughtful form that does not overwhelm prospective customers with too many options that might chase them away or frustrate them. A well designed form will make your new potential customers click the submit button.</p>

        <p>The “choice overload” phenomenon is also good to keep in mind when designing your web forms. Choice overload occurs when we are inundated with too many options. Have you ever gone to a restaurant with a menu that makes you feel like you need to buy the Cliff’s Notes version? When designing your website’s form, we will streamline the options to be as clear and simple so that you get the information that you need, and customers will feel like the process of contacting you is easy.</p>
